## Contributing

Before you submit a pull request with your change, please be sure to:

* Add new tests that prove your change works as expected.
* Ensure all existing tests are still passing.

Once you're sure everything is still working, open a pull request with a clear
description of what you changed and why. I will not accept a pull request which
breaks existing tests or adds new functionality without tests.

The exception to this would be refactoring existing code or changing documentation.
